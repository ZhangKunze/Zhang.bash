This project contains a Bash script for simple permission check and path display, along with a detailed explanation. It is primarily designed for Termux (Android) but supports cross-system use with minor adjustments.
 
1. Project File Structure
 
-  [Your Script Name].bash : The core executable Bash script (e.g.,  path_check.bash ).
​
-  script_explanation.txt : Detailed English explanation of the script (included in this README for convenience).

3. Script Function Explanation

Step Code Segment Function Description 
1  #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash  Specifies the Bash interpreter path for Termux, ensuring the system runs the script correctly. 
2  echo "Current path is:"; sleep 3; echo $PWD  Prints a path prompt, pauses for 3 seconds, then outputs the current working directory (via the  $PWD  variable). 
3  echo "Check the directory yourself..."; sleep 2  Outputs a direct directory reminder and pauses for 2 seconds. 
4  echo "So boring"; sleep 5  Prints a casual message and pauses for 5 seconds. 
5  echo "Let me check your permissions"; sleep 4; whoami  Prompts for permission check, pauses for 4 seconds, then outputs the current username (to confirm user identity). 
6  echo "Why are the permissions so low..."; sleep 7  Prompts for permission elevation and pauses for 7 seconds. 
7  sh rish  Launches the RISH tool to attempt permission elevation (requires Shizuku configuration, see Section 5). 
 
4. Cross-System Usage Guide
 
The script defaults to Termux (Android) compatibility. For other systems, adjust the interpreter path first:
 
1. Check your system’s Bash path: Run  which bash  in the terminal. Common paths include:
​
- Linux/macOS:  /bin/bash  or  /usr/bin/bash 
​
- Windows (WSL): Same as Linux (e.g.,  /bin/bash )
​
2. Modify the script header: Use a text editor (e.g., nano, VS Code) to open the  .bash  file, and replace the original interpreter path with your system’s Bash path.
​
3. Grant execution permission: Run  chmod +x [Your Script Name].bash  in the terminal.
​
4. Run the script: Execute  ./[Your Script Name].bash  to start the script.
 
5. RISH Tool Prerequisites (for Permission Elevation)
 
RISH is a shell tool associated with Shizuku (abbreviated as "SS"), an Android permission management tool. To use its permission elevation function:
 
1. Install the Shizuku app on your Android device (download from the official website or Google Play).
​
2. Open Shizuku, follow the on-screen prompts to complete device authorization, and grant Termux relevant permissions (critical for RISH to work).
​
3. If  sh rish  fails to execute, recheck Shizuku’s authorization status for Termux.
